// Task 1: Can you create a new variable called petsAge. Your pet has an age of 13


// Task 2: Using console.log can you print out your pets age on the screen?



// Task 3: Can you console log the type of petsAge


// Introducing advanced console abilities
// Within the console it is possible to add more than one variable like so:
// var myName = 'David';
// var myAge = 25;
// console.log(myName + myAge); // David25
// You can also put strings inside the console like so:
// console.log('I am called ' + myName + '. I am ' + myAge + ' years old');
// I am called David. I am 25 years old


// Task 4: Can you console log the following: 'My pet is XX years old' replacing XX with your pets age


// Task 5: Can you create a new variable called hasBeenFed. This determines whether you pet
// has been fed. You pet has currently not been fed.

// Where <true/false> is the variable hasBeenFed.


// Task 6: Your pet has now been fed. Change hasBeenFed to true.
