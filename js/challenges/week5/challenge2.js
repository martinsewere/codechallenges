  and put it back into the employee variable. Try using a forEach function
*/

  Can you write a function which reverses the string that has been passed in
  Remember that a string is an array of characters so you can loop through the string passed in
*/

function reverseName(fullName) {
 // Use this to store the final revered name
 var reversedName;

 // This should print out the revered name
 console.log(reversedName)
}

reverseName(employees[0]); // Should output to the console: lleryT evetS
