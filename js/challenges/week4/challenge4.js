/*
* Task 1 - Write a for loop which runs 5 times and prints out the loop number
*/




/*
* Task 2 - Write a for loop which logs out each product
*/
var products = ['broadband', 'fibre broadband', 'mobile', 'tv', 'phone'];



/*
* Task 3 - Reverse For loop. Currently we have looked at looping forwards only
* Can you make a loop which counts down from 10 to 0 inclusively
*/



/*
* Task 4 - functions again
* Make a function called printFirstLetter, it should take a string as a variable
* and then return the first letter of the string.
* HINT: a string is essentially an array of characters. This means you can access
* characters using the array notation
* var name = 'Stuart';
* console.log(name[0]); // returns 'S'
*/




/*
* Task 4 - Functions in loops
* Can you make a for loop which prints out the first letter of each product
* HINT: Use your printFirstLetter function from Task 4
